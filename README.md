# Express-Common-Middleware
An express common middlewares for my applications. I have created an npm module for easily scalable and reusable middleware and util components. You can create a new npm package and update the package.json file with valid module name.

# Npm run pub
I run npm run pub after every change to clean my build directory and update the module. Since this script is solely for development purposes i do not recommend to use it in your own packages and modules.
